## üß© Components in the Model

The 6-DOF robotic arm consists of the following main components:
- **Base**
- **Shoulder**
- **Upper Arm**
- **Elbow**
- **Wrist**
- **End Effector (Gripper or Tool)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **CAD Software**: SolidWorks
- **Simulation Platform**: ANSYS Workbench
- **Analysis Type**:
  - Transient Structural Analysis

## üîç Analysis Summary

### **Transient Structural Analysis**
- Purpose: To simulate the robotic arm's response under time-varying loads, including impact, motion, and dynamic forces during operation.
- Objective: Evaluate the deformation, stress distribution, and potential failure due to dynamic loading conditions.
- Observations: Investigated the arm‚Äôs behavior during different operating conditions, particularly focusing on joint and link response over time.
- Output: Time-based deformation, stress, and displacement plots, allowing for an understanding of the system's dynamic performance.

## üìä Results

You can find the following analysis results in the `/Results` folder:
- **Time-based deformation and stress contours**
- **Displacement response under transient loading**
- **Impact and load distribution visualizations**
- Detailed **transient structural reports** that describe the findings.

## üìå How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the CAD model in SolidWorks (2021 or later).
3. Open the ANSYS Workbench project files.
4. Navigate to the **Transient Structural** analysis system.
5. Modify the loading conditions or geometry, and re-run the simulations as needed.
